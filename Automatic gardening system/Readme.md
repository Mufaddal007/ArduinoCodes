# this project is created for Attiny micrcontroller
# it basicllay turns on the solenoid value for a specific moisture level window, as soon as the dry6ness level increases above 70% the the moicture 
# sensor will detecct this and the microcontroller will turn on the valve and it will keep it on until it is above a threshold limit, as soon as the value 
# is crossed, microcontrloler will switch the valve off.
